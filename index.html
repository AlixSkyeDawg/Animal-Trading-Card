						Displacer beasts are large cat-like creatures with six legs and a pair of tentacles 5 feet long sprouting from their shoulders.
			    		They're covered in blue-black fur and are usually about 9 feet long. Displacer beasts are not just hunters and predators, they're also killers.
						They enjoy the pusuit and kill for sport.
